       <p> Widely known for their remarkable talents in the kitchen, Ghetto Gastro is taking their talents to the world of sneakers
           by cooking up this forthcoming collaboration with Jordan Brand. Doing what chefs do best by introducing the new,
           the culinary collective gives the Jumpman’s first ever silhouette some exciting new flair, reworking its
           stylings to thus create the Air Jordan 1 Low React “Fear Inspired by New York City’s ability to converge design, art,
           and empowerment, this half-bootie design collides a mixture of jet black nubuck, nylon, and leather for its upper constructions,
           followed by reflective burgundy Swoosh logos and a lacing system influenced by the Air Jordan XI. But it doesn’t stop there
           ,for the first time ever, the Air Jordan 1 Low is seen utilizing a full React-cushioning system reinforced with
           exaggerated ridges for enhanced grip.
           Expect these to drop on November 14th at select Jumpman retailers, and see a closer look here ahead.
